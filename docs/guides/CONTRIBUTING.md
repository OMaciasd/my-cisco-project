## 🏁 Getting Started

---

### 🔧 Prerequisites

Before contributing, ensure you have the following:

3. Any required software or tools as listed in the project's README.

## 🛠️ How to Contribute

We appreciate your interest in contributing to this project! Here are the steps you need to follow to get started:

---

### 🍽️ 1. Fork the Repository

Start by forking the repository to your GitHub account. Then, clone the repository to your local machine to begin working on your contribution.

1. Clone your fork to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/omaciasd/beginner-web-development.git

   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd beginner-web-development

   ```

---

### 🌱 2. Create a Branch

It's important to create a separate branch for each feature or bug fix. This helps keep the main branch clean and makes it easier to manage different changes.

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-name

   ```

Replace `feature-name` with a descriptive name for your branch. For example, if you're working on adding a new login feature, you might name the branch add-login-feature.

---

### ✏️ 3. Make Your Changes

Now you can start working on your changes. Whether you're fixing a bug, adding a new feature, or improving documentation, make sure your code follows the project's conventions.

- Write clean, readable code and follow the **style guide**.

- Test your changes thoroughly to ensure they work as intended.

- Update documentation if your changes affect the project's behavior or setup.

---

### 💾 4. Commit Your Changes

Once you're happy with your changes, commit them to your branch with a descriptive commit message:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Describe the change or feature"

   ```

Make sure your commit messages are clear and describe the purpose of the changes.

---

### 🚀 5. Push Your Changes

Push your changes to your forked repository:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature-name

   ```

This will upload your changes to your remote fork, ready for review.

---

### 🔄 6. Create a Pull Request (PR)

Once your branch is pushed, go to the original repository and create a pull request (PR) from your forked repository. The PR should:

- Be against the **main** branch of the repository.
Include a clear description of what changes you've made and why.

- Reference any issues that the PR addresses.

- Once your PR is reviewed and approved, it will be merged into the main project.

---

### 📝 7. Address Review Feedback

Project maintainers may suggest or require changes before your PR is merged. Please address any feedback promptly and push the necessary changes back to your branch.
