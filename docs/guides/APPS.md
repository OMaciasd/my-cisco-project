   - The foundational structure of any web page.

   - Defines elements like headings, paragraphs, images, and links.

   - Example:

     ```html
     <h1>Welcome to Web Development</h1>
     <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
     ```

2. **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**

   - Used for styling and layout.

   - Controls the appearance of HTML elements, including colors, fonts, and spacing.

   - Example:

     ```css
     body {
       font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
       background-color: #f4f4f9;
     }
     ```

3. **JavaScript**

   - Adds interactivity to web pages.

   - Enables dynamic content, user interaction, and logic.

   - Example:

     ```javascript
     document.querySelector('h1').textContent = 'Hello, JavaScript!';
     ```
